# Problem 13.257 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.257
> Show that the [[Definition 12.4 MA-111|splitting field]] of $x^{n}-1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is a [[Definition 13.4 MA-111|radical extension]] (and therefore that this polynomial is solvable by radicals), for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $f(x)=x^{n} -1 \in \mathbb{Q}[x]$. Let $\omega=e^{\pi i/n}$. We have shown previously that $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ is the splitting field of of $f(x)$. If we choose $k_{1}=5$, $\omega^{5}=1 \in \mathbb{Q}$, so $\mathbb{Q}(\omega)$ is a radical extension, and $f(x)$ is solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$.
