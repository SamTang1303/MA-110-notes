# Problem 4.55 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 4.55
> Consider the group $S_{3}$, and the subgroup $K=\langle (1\,2\,3)\rangle=\{ (1), (1\,2\,3),(1\,3\,2) \}$ of $S_{3}$. List the distinct left cosets of $K$ in $S_{3}$, and list the elements of each of these. How many distinct left cosets are there for $K$?

$$
\begin{align}
(1)K = (1\,2\,3)K= (1\,3\,2)K &= \{ (1), (1\,2\,3),(1\,3\,2) \}\\
(1\,2)K = (1\,3)K = (2\,3)K &= \{ (1\,2), (2\,3), (1\,3) \}.
\end{align}
$$
Thus, there are tow distinct left cosets for $K$.
