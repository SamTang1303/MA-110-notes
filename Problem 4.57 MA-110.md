# Problem 4.57 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 4.57
> Prove or disprove as appropriate: Suppose $G$ is a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$, and $a$ and $b$ elements of $G$. If $aH=bH$, then $a=b$.

The statement above is false. A counterexample is given in [[Problem 4.55 MA-110|Problem 55]], where $(1)K=(1\,2\,3)K$, but clearly $(1)\neq(1\,2\,3)$.
