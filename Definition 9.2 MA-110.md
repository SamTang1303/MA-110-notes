# Definition of reducible and irreducible polynomials

> [!definition] Definition 9.2 MA-110 - reducible and irreducible polynomials
> Let $F$ be a field. A non-constant polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$ is called **reducible** over $F$ if it can be factored into two polynomials of lower degree. that is, if there exists $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ with $\deg(p)<\deg(f)$ and $\deg(q)<\deg(f)$ and $f(x)=p(x)q(x)$. A non-constant polynomial is called **irreducible** over $F$ if it is not reducible over $F$.
