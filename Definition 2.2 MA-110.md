# Definition of closure under and operation and closure under inverse

> [!definition] Definition 2.2 MA-110 - closure under and operation and closure under inverse
> - We say that $H$ is **closed** under the operation $*$ if for all $a$ and $b$ in $H$, $a*b$ is in $H$. (Sometimes one says "the operation $*$ is closed on $H$.")
> - We say that "$H$ is closed under taking inverses if for all $a$ in $H$, the inverse of $a$ is in $H$.
