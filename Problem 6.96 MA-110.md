# Problem 6.96 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 6.96
> Without consulting any textbooks, the internet, or anyone else, make a guess at a definition of a **subring**. Find a non-trivial example of a subring that fits your definition.

> [!definition] Sam's definition of a subring
> Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $S$ of $R$ is defined to be a **subring** if it satisfies the following criteria.
> 1. $S$ contains the additive identity of $R$.
> 2. $S$ is closed under both the addition and multiplication of $R$.
> 3. $S$ is closed under inverses.

For example, consider the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ with addition and multiplication. We will show that the even numbers are a subring of $\mathbb{Z}$.
1. $0$ is even, meaning the even numbers contain the additive identity of $\mathbb{Z}$.
2. The sum of the two evens is an even, and the product of two evens is an even, so the even numbers are closed under addition and multiplication.
3. The negative of any even number is also even, therefore the set is closed under inverses.
Thus, the even numbers satisfy all the criteria to be a subring of $\mathbb{Z}$.
