# Definition of isomorphisms and isomorphic

> [!definition] Definition 3.1.2 MA-110 - isomorphisms and isomorphic
> A [[Definition 3.1.1 MA-110|homomorphism]] that is one-to-one and onto is an **isomorphism**. We say that groups $G$ and $H$ are **isomorphic** if there exists an isomorphism $\phi:G\longrightarrow H$ between them.
