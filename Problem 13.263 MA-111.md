# Problem 13.263 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.263
> Show that $S_{4}$ is solvable.

Consider the group $S_{4}$. $A_{4}$ is a subgroup of index 2, so $A_{4}\lhd S_{4}$ ([[Problem 10.172 MA-111|Problem 172]]), and $S_{4}/A_{4}$ is abelian. In [[Problem 5.69 MA-110|Problem 69]] we showed that $V=\langle (1\ 3)(2\ 4),(1\ 2)(3\ 4),(1\ 4)(2\ 3)\rangle$ is normal in $A_{4}$. Further, because $[A_{4}: V]=3$, $A_{4}/V$ must be abelian. All groups of order $4$ are abelian, so $V/\{ e \}=V$ is abelian. Thus, $S_{4}$ is solvable.
