# Problem 9.154 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 9.154
> Find an example of a commutative ring in which the polynomial $x^{2}-1$ has more than two distinct roots.

Consider the commutative ring $\mathbb{Z}_{8}[x]$ and the polynomial $f(x)=x^{2}-1$.
$$
\begin{align}
f(1) &= 1^{2}-1 =0 \\
f(3) &= (3)^{2}-1=1-1=0 \\
f(5)&= (5)^{2}-1=1-1=0.
\end{align}
$$
Thus, $1,3,$ and $5$ are all roots of $f(x)=x^{2}-1$.
