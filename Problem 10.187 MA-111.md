# Problem 10.187 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 10.187
> The group $K$ of [[Problem 10.186 MA-111|Problem 186]] is called the **normalizer** of $H$ in $G$, written $N[H]$. Explain why $N[H]$ is the biggest subgroup of $G$ that $H$ is normal in.

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$. Let $J$ be any normal subgroup of $G$ that $H$ is normal in. Let $j \in J$. By the definition of normality, $jH=Hj \implies jHj^{-1}=H$. Thus $j \in N[H]$, and $J \subseteq N[H]$.
