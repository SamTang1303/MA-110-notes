# Definition of orbits

> [!definition] Definition 10.8 MA-111â€”Orbits
> If a group $G$ [[Definition 10.6 MA-111|acts]] on a set $X$, the **orbit** $Gx$ of all element $x \in X$ is the set of all elements that $x$ can be sent to under the action. That is, $Gx=\{ \phi_{g}(x) \mid g \in G \}$. (It is easy to see that the orbits form a partition of $X$.)
