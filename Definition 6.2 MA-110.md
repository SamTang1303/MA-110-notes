# Definition of kernel in a ring

> [!definition] Definition 6.2 MA-110 - kernel in a ring
> Suppose that $R$ and $S$ are rings, and that $\phi: R \longrightarrow S$ is a ring homomorphism. The **kernel** of $\phi$, denoted by $\ker(\phi)$, is defined to be the set $\{ r \in R : \phi(r) = 0 \}$, where $0$ is the additive identity of $S$.
