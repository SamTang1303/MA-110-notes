# Problem 10.188 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 10.188
> Suppose that $G$ is a finite group. Consider the action of a subgroup $H$ on the set $X$ of left cosets of $H$ in $G$, given in [[Problem 10.179 MA-111|Problem 179]].
> 1. Explain why $[G:H]$ = $\left| X \right|$.
> 2. Explain why $[N[H]:H]=\left| X_{H} \right|$.

1. Definitionally, $\left| X \right|=\left| G/H \right|=[G:H]$
2. Since $H$ is normal in $N[H]$, every group action is trivial, so every coset will be in $N[H]/H$, and $[N[H]:H]=\left| X_{H} \right|$.
