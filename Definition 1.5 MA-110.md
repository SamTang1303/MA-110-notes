# Definition of abelian, finite groups, infinite groups, and group order

> [!definition] Definition 1.5 MA110 - abelian, finite groups, infinite groups, and group order
> - A group $\langle G,*\rangle$ is said to be **abelian** if $*$ is [[Definition 1.3 MA-110|commutative]].
> - We say a group is **finite** if the underlying set contains finitely many elements. We say a group is **infinite** if the underlying set contains infinitely many elements.
> - For a finite group $G$, the **order** of $G$ is the number of elements in $G$. We also say that an infinite group has **infinite order**.
