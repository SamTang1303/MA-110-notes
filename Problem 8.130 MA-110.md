# Problem 8.130 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 8.130
> Suppose that $R$ is a commutative ring with unity, and that the only ideas of $R$ and $R$ and $\{ 0 \}$. Prove that $R$ is a field. (This is the converse of [[Problem 8.120 MA-110|Problem 120]].)

Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity such that the only ideals of $R$ are $R$ and $\{ 0 \}$. Let $r \in R$ such that $r \neq0$. Then $(r)$ is a principal ideal by [[Problem 6.105 MA-110|Problem 105]]. Since it is not just $0$, it must be equal to $R$ by assumption. Therefore $1 \in (r)$, meaning that some number multiplied by $r$ is one, by the definition of an [[Definition 6.3 MA-110|ideal]]. This number is the inverse of $r$. Therefore, every element of $R$ has an inverse, and $R$ is a ring.
