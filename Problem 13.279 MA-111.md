# Problem 13.279 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.279
> Let $G$ be a group of order $2^{k}$, for some $k\geq1$. Recall ([[Problem 10.200 MA-111|Problem 200]]) that its center $Z(G)$ is nontrivial. Use an induction argument similar to the one used in the proof of Sylow I (Section 10.5) to show that $G$ has a subgroup of index 2.

Let $G$ be a group of order $2^{k}$, for some $k\geq1$. By the proof of Sylow Theorem 1, there will be a subgroup of $G$ of every divisor of $2^{k}$. Therefore, there will exist a subgroup $H$ such that $\left| H \right|=2^{k-1}$ and $[G:H]=2$.
