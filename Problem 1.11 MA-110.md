# Problem 1.11 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 1.11
> Suppose $\langle G,*\rangle$ is a group, with $s,t$ and $u$ in $G$. Prove or disprove as appropriate:
> If $s*t=u*s$, then $t=u$

*Proof.* We will disprove by counterexample. Consider the group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. $\rho_{1}, \rho_{2, }\mu_{1, }$ are all elements of the group. Referring back to the table on page 2, $\mu_{1}\circ\rho_{1}=\mu_{3}=\rho_{2}\circ\mu_{1}$. Clearly $\rho_{1}\neq \rho_{2}$, so the proposed theorem must be false.
