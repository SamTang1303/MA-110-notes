# Problem 9.167 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 9.167
> Explain why the [[Problem 9.166 MA-110|previous problem]] establishes the following fact: In a PID, ever nonzero prime ideal is maximal.

In the [[Problem 9.166 MA-110|Problem 166]], our argument showed that if $R$ is a PID and $I$ is a prime ideal, then every ideal $J$ such that $I\subseteq J$ is either equal to $I$, or is not a proper ideal of $R$. I.e., $I$ is a maximal ideal of $R$.
