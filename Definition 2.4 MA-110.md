# Definition of S4, the permutation group and cycle notation

> [!definition] Definition 2.4 MA-110 - S4, the permutation group and cycle notation
> The **permutation group and cycle notation** $S_{4}$ consists of the following 24 elements: $(1),(1\ 2), (1\ 3), (1\ 4), (2\ 3), (2\ 4), (3\ 4), (1\ 2\ 3), (1\ 2\ 4), (1\ 3\ 2), (1\ 3\ 4), (1\ 4\ 2), (1\ 4\ 3), (2\ 3\ 4), (2\ 4\ 3), (1\ 2)(3\ 4), (1\ 3)(2\ 4), (1\ 4)(2\ 3), (1\ 2\ 3\ 4), (1\ 2\ 4\ 3), (1\ 3\ 4\ 2), (1\ 4\ 2\ 3), (1\ 4\ 3\ 2)$. These elements represent the $4!$ permutations of the symbols $1,2,3,4$ given in cyclic notation. In a cycle $(a_{1}\ a_{2}\ a_{3}\  \cdots\ a_{n})$, the corresponding permutation moves $a_{1}$ to $a_{2}$, $a_{2}$ to $a_{3}$, and so on, with the last element $a_{k}$ moving to $a_{1}$. Cycles (and therefore permutations) are multiplied by performing their actions from right to left, as with function composition. For example:
> $$
> (1\ 2\ 4)(2\ 4\ 3) = (1\ 2)(3\ 4).
> $$
> Similar definitions yield the groups $S_{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
