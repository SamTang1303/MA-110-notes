# Problem 1.19 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 1.19
> Prove or disprove as appropriate: If $G$ is a group, with $a$ and $b$ in $G$, then $(ab)^{2}=a^{2}b^{2}$.

We will disprove by counterexample. Let $G$ be the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, and let $a=\rho_{1}$ and $b=\mu_{1}$.
$$
(ab)^{2}=(\rho_{1}\mu_{1})^{2}=(\mu_{2})^{2}= \rho_{0}
$$
But,
$$
a^{2}b^{2} = \rho_{1}^{2}\mu_{1}^{2} = \rho_{2}\mu_{1}=\mu_{3}.
$$
Because these two quantities are not equal the theorem must be false.
