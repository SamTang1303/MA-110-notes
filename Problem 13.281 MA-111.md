# Problem 13.281 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.281
> Explain how the preceding problems constitute a proof of Theorem 31.7

Let $p(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$. Let $K$ be the splitting field of $p(x)$ over $\mathbb{R}$ and $E$ be the splitting field of $(x^{2}+1)p(x)$ over $\mathbb{R}$. Note that $K\subseteq E$. A combination of problem [[Problem 13.278 MA-111|278]] and [[Problem 13.280 MA-111|280]] shows that $\left| \text{Gal}(E/\mathbb{C}) \right|=1$. Therefore, by the Galois Correspondence, $[E:\mathbb{C}]=1$ and $E=\mathbb{C}$. Therefore, $K\subseteq \mathbb{C}$, and all of the roots of $p(x)$ are contained in the complex numbers.
