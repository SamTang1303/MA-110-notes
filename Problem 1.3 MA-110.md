> [!problem] Problem 1.3
> Determine which of the binary operations in Problem 1 are commutative, and if not, provide proof that the operation is not commutative.

- Addition on $\mathbb{Z}$: Is commutative.
- Subtraction on $\mathbb{Z}$: Is not commutative. $1-2=-1\neq2-1$.
- Composition on [[D4 - The group symmetries of a square MA-110]]: Is commutative.
- Composition on the set of rotations in [[D4 - The group symmetries of a square MA-110]]: Is commutative.
- Multiplication modulo 6 in $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$: Is commutative.
