# Definition of associativity, identity, and inverses in a group MA110

> [!definition] Definition 1.2 - Definition of associativity, identity, and inverses in a group
> A binary operation is **associative** if $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$ for all $a,b,c \in A$. An element $e$ is said to be an **identity** for $*$ if $a*e=e*a$ for all $a \in A$. An element $b$ is an **inverse** of the element $a$ if $a*b=b*a=e$.
