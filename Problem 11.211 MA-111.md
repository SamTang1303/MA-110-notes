# Problem 11.211 MA-111

> Use the Algebraic Extension Theorem to give a quick proof of [[Problem 11.206 MA-111|Problem 206]]

We can think of $a_{0}+b_{0}\sqrt{ 2 }$ and $a_{1}+b_{1}\sqrt{  2}$ as elements of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{ 2 })$. $\text{Irr}(\sqrt{ 2 },\mathbb{Q})=x^{2}-2$. The Algebraic Extension Theorem tells us that $\{ 1,\sqrt{ 2 } \}$ forms a basis for all such elements. From linear algebra, we know that every element of a given vector space has a unique representation as a linear combination of the basis elements. Thus, if $a_{0}+b_{0}\sqrt{ 2 }=a_{1}+b_{1}\sqrt{ 2 }$, it follows that $a_{0}=a_{1}$ and $b_{0}=b_{1}$.
