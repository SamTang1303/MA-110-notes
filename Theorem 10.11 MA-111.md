# Theorem 10.11 MA-111

> [!definition] Theorem 10.11â€”The Sylow Theorems
> Let $G$ be a group of order $p^{n}m$, where $p$ is a prime and $p$ does not divide $m$.
> 1. $G$ has a subgroup of order $p^{n}$. (Such a subgroup is called a **Sylow $p$-subgroup**.)
> 2. Any two Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate.
> 3. The number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of $G$ is congruent to 1 modulo $p$ and divides $\left| G \right|$.

A sketch of the proof of part one is given at the beginning of chapter 10.5.
