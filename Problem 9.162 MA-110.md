> Let $F$ be a field, and suppose that $p(x) \in F[x]$ is an irreducible polynomial. Show that $(p(x))$ is a prime ideal of $F[x]$.

Let $F$ be a field, and suppose that $p \in F[x]$ is an irreducible polynomial. Let $a,b \in F[x]$ such that $ab \in (p)$. Then $p\mid ab$ and and [[Problem 9.161 MA-110|Problem 161]] implies that $p\mid a$ or $p\mid b$, i.e. $a \in (p)$ or $b \in (p)$. Thus $(p)$ is a [[Definition 9.3 MA-110|prime ideal]].
