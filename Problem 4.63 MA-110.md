# Problem 4.63 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 4.63
> Consider the subgroup $H=\langle (1\,2\,3\,4)\rangle$ of $S_{5}$.
> 1. What is $\left| S_{5} \right|$?
> 2. What is $\left| H \right|$?
> 3. How big are the cosets of $H$ in $S_{5}$?
> 4. How many distinct cosets of $H$ in $S_{5}$ are there? (Use [[Problem 4.61 MA-110|Problem 61]].)
> 5. Do you think that $S_{5}$ has a subgroup of order 7? Why or why not?

1. $\left| S_{5} \right|=5! =120$.
2. $\left| H \right|=4$
3. As proved in the problem above, all the cosets will have the same order as $H$, 4.
4. In [[Problem 4.61 MA-110|Problem 61]], we showed that cosets are either disjoint or equal. So, if each distinct coset has order 4, there must be 30 distinct cosets comprising the group.
5. No, if it had a subgroup of order 7, our answers would indicate we could "partition" the set into distinct cosets each with order 7. But 120 does not divide 7 evenly, so this does not seem possible.
