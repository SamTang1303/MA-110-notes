# Definition of Cartesian product and Cartesian product group multiplication

> [!definition] Definition 2.7 MA110 - Cartesian product and Cartesian product group multiplication
> Recall that the **Cartesian product** of two sets $X$ and $Y$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$. Suppose that $\langle G, *_{G}\rangle$ and $\langle H,*_{H}\rangle$ are [[Definition 1.4 MA-110|groups]].  Define an operation $*$ on $G\times H$ as follows: for all $(g_{1},h_{1})$ and $(g_{2},h_{2})$ in $G\times H$, define $(g_{1},h_{1})*(g_{2},h_{2})$ to be $(g_{1}*_{G}g_{2},h_{1}*_{H}h_{2})$.

> [!note] 
> In practice, we often use multiplicative notation for all three of these operations, writing $(g_{1},h_{1})(g_{2},h_{2})=(g_{1}g_{2},h_{1}h_{2})$ where the operation in the first coordinate is the operation in $G$, and the operation in the second coordinate is the operation in $H$. (We often express this idea by saying that the operation on $G\times H$ is defined "component-wise".)
