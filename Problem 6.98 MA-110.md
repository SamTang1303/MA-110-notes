# Problem 6.98 MA-110

> Let $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients. Fix $a \in \mathbb{Z}$. It is easy to check that the map $\varepsilon_{a}: \mathbb{Z}[x] \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $\varepsilon_{a}(p(x))=p(a)$ is a ring homomorphism. Take this as given. The map $\varepsilon_{a}$ is called the **evaluation homomorphism**.
> 1. Compute the kernel of $\varepsilon_{0}$.
> 2. Compute the kernel of $\varepsilon_{3}$.

1. The kernel of $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients $p(x)$ that evaluates to $0$ at $x=0$. This will be the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients such that the constant term of the polynomial is non-zero.
2. The kernel of $\varepsilon_{0}$ is the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients $p(x)$ that evaluates to $0$ at $x=3$. In other words, the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients that pass through the point $(3,0)$.
