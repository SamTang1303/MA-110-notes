> Suppose $G$ is a group, $H$ a subgroup of $G$, and $a \in G$. Prove or disprove as appropriate: If $aH=H$, then $a \in H$.

Let $G$ be a group with subgroup $H$, and $a \in G$. Let $aH=H$.

Suppose to the contrary that $a \notin H$. $e_{H} \in H$ by the definition of a subgroup. Therefore, $ae_{H} \in aH$. But $ae_{H}=a$ and $aH=H$, implying $a \in H$. This is a contradiction, implying that our assumption must be false, and $a \in H$.
