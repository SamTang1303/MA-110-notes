# Problem 4.54 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 4.54
> Consider the group $D_{4}$, and the subgroup $H=\langle \delta_{1}\rangle=\{ \rho_{0},\delta_{1} \}$ of $D_{4}$. List the distinct left cosets of the form $aH$ for $a \in D_{4}$, and list the elements of each of these. How many distinct (not equal) left cosets are there for $H$?

$$
\begin{align}
&\rho_{0}H = \delta_{1}H =\{ \rho_{0},\delta_{1} \} \\
&\rho_{1}H = \mu_{2}H = \{ \rho_{1}, \mu_{2} \} \\
&\rho_{2}H = \delta_{2}H = \{ \rho_{2}, \delta_{2} \} \\
&\rho_{3}H = \mu_{1}H = \{ \rho_{3}, \mu_{1} \}. \\
\end{align}
$$
Thus, we can see there are four distinct cosets.
