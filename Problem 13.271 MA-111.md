# Problem 13.271 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.271
> The polynomial $x^{5}-4x+2$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. Explain why $x^{5}-4x+2$ is not solvable by radicals.

Let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^{5}-4x+2$. 
- In [[Problem 13.268 MA-111|Problem 268]] we showed that $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ contains a 5-cycle.
- In [[Problem 13.269 MA-111|Problem 269]] we showed that it contains a 2-cycle.
- [[Problem 12.231 MA-111|Problem 231]] says that $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic subgroup of $S_{5}$.
- [[Problem 13.270 MA-111|Problem 270]] says that no proper subgroup of $S_{5}$ can contain both a 5 cycle and a 2-cycle. Therefore, $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})\simeq S_{5}$.
- [[Problem 13.267 MA-111|Problem 267]] says that $S_{5}$ is not a solvable group.
- Galois' Great Theorem implies that $x^{5}-4x+2$ is not solvable by radicals.
