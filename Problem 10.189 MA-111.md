# Problem 10.189 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 10.189
> Apply the mod-$p$ class equation of [[Problem 10.182 MA-111 (Presenter)|Problem 182]] to prove that if $\left| H \right|=p^{i}$ for some prime $p$, then $[G:H] \equiv [N[H]:H]$ mod $p$.

Let $H$ be a subgroup of a group $G$ such that $\left| H \right|=p^{i}$ for some prime $p$. Problem 182 says that
$$
\left| X \right| = [G:H] \equiv \left| X_{H} \right| \text{ mod }p.
$$
Combining this with the result from the last problem, that $\left| X_{H} \right|=[N[H]:H]$, yields the desired result.
