# Problem 4.65 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 4.65
> Prove that every group of prime order is cyclic.

Let $G$ be a group of prime order. For any $g \in G$, the order of $G$ must be either $1$ or $\left| G \right|$  ([[Problem 4.64 MA-110|Problem 64]]). The only element that can have order one is the identity, so all other elements must have order $\left| G \right|$, meaning they generate every element of the group.
