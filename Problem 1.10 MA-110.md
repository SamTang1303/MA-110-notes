# Problem 1.10 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 1.10
> Provide at least two examples of non-abelian groups. For one of these, prove that the group is non-abelian. *This problem was worked on with Brenna Corcoran.*

1. The set of all 2x2 matrices with real entries and non-zero determinants along with matrix multiplication. *Proof.* $$\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 3 \\
2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
8 & 5 \\
20 & 13
\end{bmatrix}\neq
\begin{bmatrix}
4 & 3 \\
2 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}=
\begin{bmatrix}
13 & 20 \\
5 & 8
\end{bmatrix}
$$
2. The group of all possible moves of a Rubik's cube along with the operation of composing those moves.
