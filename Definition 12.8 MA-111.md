# Definition of the formal derivative

> [!definition] Definition 12.8 MA-111â€”The formal derivative
> This definition is algebraic, not analytical; the field $F$ need only satisfy the algebraic field axioms, not the axioms of the real or complex numbers. It is easy to prove, using only algebra, that the formal derivative has many of the familiar properties of the calculus derivative, including linearity, the product rule, and the chain rule.
