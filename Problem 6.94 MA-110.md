> Let $R$ be a ring of unity, and let $-1$ denote the additive inverse of $1$. Prove that $-1 \cdot-1=1$.

Let $R$ be a ring of unity, and let $-1$ denote the additive inverse of $1$.
$$
\begin{align}
-1 + (-1 \cdot -1) &= -1(1 + (-1)) && \text{associativity of multiplication} \\
&= -1 \cdot 0 && \text{definition of additive inverse}\\
&= 0. && \text{Problem 92}
\end{align}
$$
Thus, $-1 \cdot-1$ is the additive inverse of $-1$, which we know to be equal to $1$.
