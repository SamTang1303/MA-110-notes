# Problem 9.165 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 9.165
> Let $M$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $R$ with unity. The following two facts are immediate corollaries of the results we have already established. Prove each result, citing the appropriate theorem(s) that establish each fact.
> 1. $M$ is maximal if and only if $R/M$ is a field.
> 2. If $M$ is maximal, then $M$ is prime.

1. Together [[Problem 8.120 MA-110|Problem 120]] and [[Problem 8.130 MA-110|Problem 130]] show that $R/M$ is a field if and only if $R/M$ has no non-trivial proper ideals. [[Problem 9.164 MA-110|Problem 164]] shows that $M$ is maximal if and only if $R/M$ has no non-trivial proper ideals. Thus $M$ is maximal if and only if $R/M$ is a field.
2. If $M$ is maximal, then $R/M$ is a field (and thus an integral domain) as shown above. By [[Problem 9.159 MA-110|Problem 159]], $M$ must then be a [[Definition 9.3 MA-110|prime ideal]].
