# Definition of the greatest common divisor

> [!definition] Definition 8.8 MA-110 - Greatest common divisor
> Let $R$ be an integral domain, and let $f(x),g(x) \in R[x]$. The **greatest common divisor** of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ is a polynomial $d(x)$ that satisfies the following three properties.
> 1. $d(x)\mid f(x)$ and $d(x)\mid g(x)$.
> 2. If $c(x) \in R[x]$ is a polynomial such that $c(x)\mid f(x)$ and $c(x)\mid g(x)$, then $c(x)\mid d(x)$.
> 3. $d(x)$ is monic.
> 
> In this case we write $d(x)=\gcd(f(x),g(x))$.
