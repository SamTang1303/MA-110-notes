# Definition of a ring

> [!definition] Definition 6.1 - Ring
> A **ring** is a set $R$ together with an addition operation $+$ and a multiplication operation $\cdot$  such that the following conditions hold.
> 1. $\langle R, +\rangle$ is an abelian group with identity $0 \in R$.
> 2. Multiplication is associative.
> 3. Multiplication is associative over addition: For all $a,b,c \in R$, $a(b+c)=ab+bc$ and $(b+c)a=ba+ca$. 
> We say that a ring is **commutative** if $ab=ba$ for all $a,b \in R$. We call a ring a **ring with unity** if there is an element $1 \in R$ such that $1 \cdot a=a \cdot1$ for all $a \in R$. In a ring with unity, the elements of a ring need not have multiplicative inverses. Elements that do have multiplicative inverses are called **units**.
