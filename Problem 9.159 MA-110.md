# Problem 9.159 MA-110

> Let $I$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $R$. Prove that if $R/I$ is an integral domain, then $I$ is a prime ideal.

Let $I$ be an ideal of a commutative ring $R$ such that $R/I$ is an integral domain. Let $a,b \notin I$. Then neither $a+I$ nor $b+I$ are zero in $R/I$. Because $R/I$ is an integral domain, $(a+I)(b+I)=ab+I$ is not equal to $I$ either. Thus $ab \notin I$ and $I$ is a prime ideal.
