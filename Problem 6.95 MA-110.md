# Problem 6.95 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 6.95
> Let $R$ be a [[Definition 6.1 MA-110|ring]] with unity. Prove that if $1=0$, then $R=\{ 0 \}$. (This ring is called the "zero ring.")

Let $R$ be a ring with unity such that $1=0$. Let $x \in R$. Then,
$$
\begin{align}
x &=1 \cdot x  &&\text{definition of 1} \\
&= 0 \cdot x && \text{by assumption} \\
&= 0. && \text{Problem 92}
\end{align}
$$
Therefore, the only element of the set $R$ can be $0$.
