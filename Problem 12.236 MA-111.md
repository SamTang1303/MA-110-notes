> Suppose that $E$ and $E'$ are two splitting fields of the same polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$. Prove that there is an isomorphism $E\longrightarrow E'$ that fixes $F$.

Let $E$ and $E'$ be two splitting fields of the same polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$. Let $\phi:F \longrightarrow F$ be the identity function. Then Theorem 12.5 guarantees there is some isomorphism $\tilde{\phi}:E \longrightarrow E'$ such that $\tilde\phi$ extends $\phi$, i.e., it fixes $F$.
