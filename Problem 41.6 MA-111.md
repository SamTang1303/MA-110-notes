1. True; $\partial^{2}=0$.
2. False; counterexample of a washer ring.
3. True; by definition.
4. True; subset of a free abelian group.
5. True; subset of a free abelian group.
6. True; quotient group of an abelian group.
7. False; it is a chain of simplexes.
8. True; $\partial_{2}:C_{2}(X)\longrightarrow C_{1}(X)$.
9. True; 0 is trivially a 2-chain.
10. True; by definition.
