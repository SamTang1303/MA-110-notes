# Problem 2.29 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 2.29
> 1. Identify all of the subgroups of $\langle \mathbb{Z},+\rangle$
> 1. Identify all of the subgroups of $\langle \mathbb{Z}_{6}, +\rangle$
> 1. Identify all of the subgroups of $\langle \mathbb{Z}_{5}^{*},\times \rangle$

1 ) A group $G$ is a subgroup of $\langle \mathbb{Z}, +\rangle$ if and only if it is of the form $\langle \{ n \cdot m : m \in \mathbb{Z} \}, +\rangle$  where $n \in \mathbb{N}$ (the set of all factors of $n$ with operation addition.) I can prove this but it's a little tedious, and the problem only asks to identify the groups. 

2 ) $\{ 0 \},\{ 0,2,4 \}, \{ 0,3 \}, \text{ and } \mathbb{Z}_{6}$ are all the possible subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$ under addition.

3 ) $\{ 1 \}, \{ 1,4 \}$ are all the possible subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_{5}^{*}$ under multiplication.
