# Definition 1.6 MA110

> [!definition] Definition 1.6
> In a group $G$ with $a \in G$, we define $a^{-n}$ to be $(a^{n})^{-1}$. Also, we define $a^{0}$ to be the identity, $e$.

> [!note]
> We showed in [[Problem 1.14 MA-110|Problem 1.14]] that $(a^{n})^{-1}$ and $(a^{-1})^{n}$ have unambiguous meanings and are equal. This justifies the use of $a^{-n}$ to cover both coases
