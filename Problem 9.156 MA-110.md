# Problem 9.156 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 9.156
> Give a counterexample to show that the conclusion of [[Problem 9.155 MA-110|Problem 155]] does not hold for polynomials of degree 4 (or higher), in general.

Consider the polynomial ring under the field of rationals $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ and the polynomial $f(x)=x^{4}+2x^{2}+1=(x^{2}+1)(x^{2}+1)$. The polynomial is clearly reducible but does not have any roots in the rationals. (This is clearly true because $f(x)$ will be greater than or equal to $1$ for all values of $x$.)
