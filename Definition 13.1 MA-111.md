# Definition of restrictions

> [!definition] Definition 13.1 MA-111â€”restrictions
> Suppose that $\phi: K \longrightarrow K'$ is a homomorphism of fields, and that $E$ is a subfield of $K$. The **restriction** $\phi \mid_{E}$ of $\phi$ to the domain $E$ is the map $\phi \mid_{E} : E \longrightarrow K'$ defined by $\phi \mid_{E}(a)=\phi(a)$ for all $a \in E$.
