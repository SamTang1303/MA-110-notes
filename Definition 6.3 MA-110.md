# Definition of an ideal

> [!definition] Definition 6.3 MA-110 - Ideals
> Let $R$ be a ring. A subset $I \subseteq R$ is called an **ideal** of $R$ if it satisfies the following properties.
> - $\langle I,+\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\langle R,+\rangle$.
> - For all $r \in R$ and $a \in I$, $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$.

This definition defines a "two-sided ideal." It is possible to consider the "left ideals" and "right ideals" which only satisfy one of the conditions $ra \in I$ and $ar \in I$, respectively. We will use the term "ideal" to refer to a two-sided ideal by default. Of course, in a commutative ring, you only have to check one of these conditions, since all ideals are two-sided.
