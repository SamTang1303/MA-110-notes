# Problem 4.67 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 4.67
> Explain why there are no nontrivial homomorphisms $\phi:\mathbb{Z}_{7}\longrightarrow S_{6}$.

Let $\phi:\mathbb{Z}\longrightarrow S_{6}$ be a non-trivial [[Definition 3.1.1 MA-110|homomorphism]].
By [[Problem 4.66 MA-110|Problem 66]], $\phi$ must be one-to-one. But if that were the case $\phi(\mathbb{Z}_{7})$ must be order 7 as well, and, by [[Problem 3.51 MA-110|Problem 51]], a subgroup of $S_{6}$. There can be no subgroups of order 7 of $S_{6}$ because $\left| S_{6} \right|=720$, which does not have a factor of 7 (Problem 64.)
