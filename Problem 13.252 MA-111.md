# Problem 13.252 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.252
> Let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^{3}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. In [[Problem 13.248 MA-11|Problem 248]] we found that $\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})=S_{3}$ , where the letters $1,2,3$ are identified with the roots $\sqrt[3]{ 2 },\omega \sqrt[3]{ 2 },\omega^{2}\sqrt[3]{ 2 }$, respectively. The lattice of subgroups of $S_{3}$ is given by the following diagram. Compute the corresponding lattice of subfields.

Let $K$ be the splitting field of $x^{3}-2$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Using our work from Problem 248 and Theorem 13.3, we can find the lattice of subfields of $K$.
