# Problem 10.176 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 10.176
> A regular tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. Its symmetry group contains reflections and rotations. If the vertices of a regular tetrahedron are labeled 1,2,3,4, show that this symmetry group is isomorphic to $S_{4}$. Find a small generating set, and do enough calculations to show that your generating set does in fact generate this group.
