# Definition of cosets

> [!definition] Definition 4.1 and 5.1 MA-110 - cosets
> Suppose $G$ is a group, with $H$ a subgroup of $G$, and $a \in G$. Then $aH$ denotes the set $\{ ah: h \in H \}$, and is called a **left coset** of $H$ in $G$ (or, if necessary, the left coset of $H$ determined by $a$). (In additive notation, the left coset of $H$ determined by $a$ is denoted $a+H$). A **right coset** of the form $Ha$ is defined similarly.
