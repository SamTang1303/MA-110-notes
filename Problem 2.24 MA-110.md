 > Is multiplication modulo 7 a binary operation on $\mathbb{Z}_{7}^{*}$? If so, write out the operation table for multiplication modulo 7 on $\mathbb{Z}_{7}^{*}$. Is $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_{7}$ a group under this operation? If not, explain why not.

| $\times$ | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| 2     | 2   | 4   | 6   | 1   | 3   | 5   |
| 3     | 3   | 6   | 2   | 5   | 1   | 4   |
| 4     | 4   | 1   | 5   | 2   | 6   | 3   |
| 5     | 5   | 5   | 1   | 6   | 4   | 2   |
| 6     | 6   | 2   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |

Yes, it is a group under this operation. It would not be if zero were included, because 0 has no inverse element, but because zero is omitted, it is.
