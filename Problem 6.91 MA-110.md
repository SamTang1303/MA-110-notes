# Problem 6.91 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 6.91
> Each set below is an example of a ring. For each example, determine whether it is commutative, whether it is a ring with unity, and if so, what the units are.
> 1. $\mathbb{Z}$, the integers under addition and multiplication,
> 2. $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$, the integers modulo $n$ under addition and multiplication.
> 3. $M_{2}(\mathbb{R})$, the set of $2\times 2$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{R}$. Addition is componentwise (add corresponding entries.), while multiplication is matrix multiplication.
> 4. $Q[x]=\{ a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+  \cdots+a_{n}x^{n} : n \in \{ 0,1,2, \dots \} \text{ and } a_{i} \in \mathbb{Q} \}$, the set of polynomials in the variable $x$ with rational coefficients. Add and multiply polynomials like you do in high school algebra: "combine like terms" and "FOIL".

1. $\mathbb{Z}$ is commutative, a ring of unity with $1$ as the identity, and only has units $1$ and $-1$.
2. $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ is commutative, a ring of unity with $1$ as the identity, and every element which is co-prime with $n$ is a unit.
3. $M_{2}(\mathbb{R})$ is not commutative, is a ring of unity with identity $\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}$, and has units of $2\times2$ matrices that have non-zero determinants.
4. $Q[x]$ is commutative, a ring of unity with $1$ as the identity, and has constant polynomials as its units.
