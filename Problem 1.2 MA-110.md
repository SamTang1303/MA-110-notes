# Problem 1.2 MA-110
> [!problem] Problem 1.2
> Refer back to those operations in Problem 1 that were binary operations. Do the following for each of these binary operations.
> 1. Determine whether the operation is associative, and if not, prove that the operation is not associative.
> 2. State whether there is an identity for the operation, and if so, identify it.
> 3. If there is an identity for the operation, determine any elements (if any) have inverses.

- Addition on $\mathbb{Z}$:
    1. Yes, it is associative.
    2. Yes, the identity for the operation is $0$.
    3. All elements of $\mathbb{Z}$ have inverses (their negative.)
- Subtraction on $\mathbb{Z}$:
    1. No, it is not associative. $(1-2)-3=-4\neq1-(2-3)=2$.
    2. Yes, the identity for the operation is $0$.
    3. All elements of $\mathbb{Z}$ have an inverses under subtraction (their negative.)
- Composition on [[D4 - The group symmetries of a square MA-110]].
    1. Yes, $D_{4}$ is associative because it is a group.
    2. Yes, the identity is $\rho_{0}$.
    3. All elements of $D_{4}$ have inverses.
- Composition on the set of rotations in [[D4 - The group symmetries of a square MA-110]].
    1. The set of rotations of $D_{4}$ is also a group, and therefore is associative.
    2. The identity of the set of rotations of $D_{4}$ is similarly $\rho_{0}$.
    3. All elements of the set of rotations of $D_{4}$ have inverses.
- Multiplication modulo 6 in $\mathbb{Z}_{6}$.
    1. Yes, it is associative.
    2. Yes, the identity for the operation is 1.
    3. Only. $1,5$  have inverse elements under multiplication modulo 6.
