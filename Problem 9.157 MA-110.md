# Problem 9.157 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 9.157
> In the ring $\mathbb{Z}$, show that $(7)$ is a prime ideal, but $(6)$ is not.

If $m \cdot n \in (7)$, then $m \cdot n=7 \cdot c$ for some $c \in \mathbb{N}$. By Euclid's Lemma, 7 must divide either $m$ or $n$, meaning either $m$ or $n$ must be in $(7)$. Thus $(7)$ is a prime ideal.

Consider despite the fact that $2, 3 \notin (6)$, $2 \cdot3=6$, which is clearly an element of $(6)$. Thus $(6)$ is not a prime ideal.
