# Problem 13.280 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.280
> Let $p(x)$, $E$, and $k$ be as in [[Problem 13.278 MA-111|Problem 278]]. Use Theorem 13.3, [[Problem 13.279 MA-111|Problem 279]], and [[Problem 13.274 MA-111|Problem 274]] to prove that $k=0$.

Let $p(x)$, $E$, and $k$ be as in [[Problem 13.278 MA-111|Problem 278]]. Suppose to the contrary that $k\geq1$. Problem 279 implies that $\text{Gal}(E/\mathbb{C})$ has a subgroup of index two, call it $H$. This By the Galois correspondence, this would imply that $E_{H}$ is an extension of $\mathbb{C}$ of degree 2. Problem 274 says that no such extension exists, so we have reached a contradiction. Therefore, $k$ must equal $0$ and $\left| \text{Gal}(E/\mathbb{C}) \right|=1$.
