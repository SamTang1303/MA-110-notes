# Problem 1.4 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 1.4
> Prove that if a binary operation $*$ on a set $A$ has an identity element, then that identity element is unique.

Let $*$ be an operation on a set with identity elements $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$. By definition of an identity,
$$
\begin{align}
e_{1} * e_{2} &= e_{1}\\
&\text{and}\\
e_{1} * e_{2} &= e_{2}\\
\end{align}
$$
Thus $e_{1}=e_{2}$, and the identity is unique.
