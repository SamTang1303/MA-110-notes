# Problem 10.181 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 10.181
> Let $G$ be the group of rotational symmetries of a polyhedron, and suppose $\left| G \right|=p$ is prime. Apply the [[Theorem 10.10 MA-111|Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem]] to infer something about the geometric structure of the polyhedron.

Let $G$ be the group of rotational symmetries of a polyhedron, and suppose $\left| G \right|=p$ is prime. The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem says that the product of the orbit and stabilizer of any vertex will be $p$. Because we are only looking at rotational symmetry, only the identity will ever map a vertex to itself, so the stabilizer will have order 1. Because $p$ is prime, this implies that the orbit will have order $p$. Geometrically, this means that there exists a rotational symmetry where any vertex can go to any symmetry. I'm not sure what an example of this would be.
