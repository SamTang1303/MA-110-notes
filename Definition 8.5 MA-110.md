# Definition of the degree of a polynomial

> [!definition] Problem 8.121 MA-110 - the degree of a polynomial
> Let $p(x) \in R[x]$ be the polynomial $p(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+  \cdots+a_{n}x^{n}$. The **degree** of $p(x)$ is the greatest integer $k$ such that $a_{k}\neq0$. Notation: $\deg(p)=k$.
