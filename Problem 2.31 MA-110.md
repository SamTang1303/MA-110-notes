# Problem 2.31 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 2.31
> In the introductory activity, we saw that the elements of the group $D_{4}$ can be written in cycle notation, and that composition of permutations corresponds to the composition of symmetries. Use cycle notation and permutation composition to do this problem.
> 1. Identify all the subgroups of $D_{4}$.
> 2. Based on the results of this problem and the previous two problems, formulate a conjecture about the order of a subgroup compared to the order of the group.

1 )
$$
D_{4} = \{ (1), (1 \, 2 \, 3), (1 \, 3 \, 2), (1 \, 2), (2 \, 3), (1 \, 3) \} \qquad \text{(order 6)}
$$
This has subgroups of
$$
\begin{align}
\{ (1) \} &\text{ (order 1)},\\
\{ (1), (1 \, 2) \}, &\text{ (order 2)},\\
\{ (1), (1 \, 3) \}, &\text{ (order 2)},\\
\{ (1), (2 \, 3) \}, &\text{ (order 2)},\\
\{ (1), (1 \, 2 \, 3) (1 \, 3 \, 2) \} &\text{ (order 3)},\\
D_{4} &\text{ (order 6)}.
\end{align}
$$
2 ) Based on the results of this problem and problems 29 and 30, I would conjecture that the order of a subgroup must be a factor of the "parent" group.
