# Definition of isotropy subgroups and stabilizers

> [!definition] Definition 10.9 MA-111â€”Isotropy subgroups and stabilizers
> If a group $G$ acts on a set $X$, the **isotropy subgroup** $G_{x}$ is the subgroup of $G$ consisting of all group elements whose action on $x$ is trivial. For this reason, the isotropy subgroup is often called the stabilizer of $x$, and is denoted $\text{stab}(x)$. In symbols,
> $$
> G_{x} = \text{stab}(x)=\{ g \in  G \mid \phi_{g}(x)=x \}.
