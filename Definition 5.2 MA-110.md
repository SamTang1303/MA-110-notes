# Definition of normal subgroups

> [!definition] Definition 4.2 MA-110 - normal subgroups
>     If $H$ is a subgroup of a group $G$, we say that $H$ is a **normal subgroup** if it satisfies the condition that $gH=Hg$ for all $g \in G$. In this case, we write $H\trianglelefteq G$ and say ""$H$ is normal in $G$."
