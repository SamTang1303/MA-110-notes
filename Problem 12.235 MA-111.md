# Problem 12.235 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 12.235
> Explain why the result of [[Problem 12.234 MA-111|Problem 234]] does not contradict Theorem 12.5. What does [[Problem 12.232 MA-111|Problem 232]] tell you about the uniqueness of the extension guaranteed by Theorem 12.5?

Problem 234 does not contradict Theorem 12.5 because $\mathbb{Q}(i\sqrt[4]{ 5 })$ is not a splitting field of any polynomial in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{ 5 })[x]$. Problem 232 tells us that the extension guaranteed by Theorem 12.5 is not unique.
