# Problem 13.245 MA-111

> [!problem] Problem 13.245
> Apply [[Problem 5.84 MA-110|The First Isomorphism Theorem]] to $\Phi$ and state a theorem about the Galois groups of the tower $F\subseteq E\subseteq K$.

By [[Problem 13.243 MA-111|Problem 243]] the kernel of $\Phi$ is $\text{Gal}(F/E)$. The First Isomorphism theorem says that for a tower of fields $F\subseteq E\subseteq K$, where $E$ and $F$ are splitting fields of polynomials in $F$,
$$
\text{Gal}(K/F)/\text{Gal}(K/E) \simeq \text{Gal}(E/F).
$$
