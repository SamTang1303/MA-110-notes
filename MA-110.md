## Notes

### Proof for 2.29 part a

*Proof.* Showing that all set-operator pairs of the given form are groups is relatively simple. For a given $n$ let $G = \{ n \cdot m : m \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ with operation addition. If $g \in G$, then $g=n \cdot m$ for some $m \in \mathbb{Z}$. $n \cdot m + n  \cdot  (-m)=0$. Because $-m \in \mathbb{Z}$, $g$ has an inverse in the set. Clearly adding two factors of $n$ will yield another factor of $n$, so $G$ is closed under addition. Finally, the set contains $0$, the identity of $\langle \mathbb{Z},+\rangle$, so it satisfies all the criteria for a subgroup. 

Now we must show that all subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ have the given form.

Let $G$ be a subgroup of $\langle \mathbb{Z}, +\rangle$. Note for any $g \in G$, $-g \in G$ as well, given the definition of a subgroup. Because $x-y$ can be re-written as $x+(-y)$, this implies the group is closed under subtraction as well.

Consider $s = \min\{ x \in G : x >0 \}$. Consider some $c \in \mathbb{Z}$. We can re-write $c$ in the following manner
$$
p  \cdot s + q \qquad \text{where }p \in  \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } q \in  \{ 0,\dots, s-1\}
$$
