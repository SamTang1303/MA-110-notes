# Definition of radical extensions

> [!definition] Definition 13.4 MA-111â€”radical extensions
> A **radical extension** of a field $F$ is an extension $F(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\dots ,\alpha_{n})$ such that there exist natural numbers $k_{1},k_{2},\dots ,k_{n}$ such that $\alpha_{i}^{k} \in F(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\dots,\alpha_{n})$ for $i=2,\dots n,$ and $a_{1}^{k_{1}} \in F$. A polynomial in $F[x]$ is **solvable by radicals** if its splitting field over $F$ is contained in some radical extension of $F$.
