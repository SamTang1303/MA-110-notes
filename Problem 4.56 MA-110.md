# Problem 4.56 MA-110

> [!problem] Problem 4.56
> Consider the group $\mathbb{Z}$, and its subgroup $H=\langle 5\rangle=5\mathbb{Z}$. List the distinct left cosets of the form $n+H$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, and list the elements of each of those. How many distinct left cosets are there for $H$?

$$
\begin{align}
0 + \mathbb{Z} &= \{\dots,-5,0,5, \dots \}\\
1 + \mathbb{Z} &= \{\dots,-4,1,6, \dots \}\\
2 + \mathbb{Z} &= \{\dots,-3,2,7, \dots \}\\
3 + \mathbb{Z} &= \{\dots,-2,3,8, \dots \}\\
4 + \mathbb{Z} &= \{\dots,-1,4,9, \dots \}\\
\end{align}
$$
For every integer $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $n+\mathbb{Z}$ will be one of the sets listed above, so there are five distinct left cosets for $H$.
