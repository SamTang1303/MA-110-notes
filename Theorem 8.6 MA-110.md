# Theorem 8.6 MA-110

> [!definition] (The Division Algorithm)
> Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity, and let $f(x),g(x) \in R[x]$. Furthermore, suppose that
> 
> $$
> \begin{align}
> f(x) &= a_{0}+a_{1}x  +a_{2}x^{2} +  \cdots +a_{m}x^{m}\\
> g(x) &= b_{0}+b_{1}x  +b_{2}x^{2} +  \cdots +b_{n}x^{n}
> \end{align}
> $$
> such that $b_{n}$ is a unit in $R$. Then there are polynomials $q(x)$ and $r(x)$ in $R[x]$ (called the "quotient" and "remainder") such that
> $$
> f(x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x)
> $$
> and either $r(x)=0$ or $\deg(r)<\deg(g)$.
