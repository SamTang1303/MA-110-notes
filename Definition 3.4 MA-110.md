# Definition of kernel

> [!definition] Definition 3.4 MA-110 - kernel
> Suppose that $G$ and $H$ are groups, and that $\phi:G\longrightarrow H$ is a homomorphism. The **kernel** of $\phi$, denoted by $\ker(\phi)$, is defined to be the set $\{ g \in G : \phi(g)=e\}$, where $e$ is the [[Definition 1.2 MA-110|identity]] of $H$.
