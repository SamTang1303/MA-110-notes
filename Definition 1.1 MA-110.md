# Definition of a binary operation MA110

> [!definition] Definition 1.1 - Binary Operation
> A **binary operation** $*$ on a set $A$ is a function $A\times A\to A$, where $(a,b)\mapsto a*b$. In other words, a binary operation inputs two elements of $a,b$ of the set $A$, and outputs a well-defined element $a*b$ on the set $A$.
