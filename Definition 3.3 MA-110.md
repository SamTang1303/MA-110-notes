# Definition of the image of a function

> [!definition] Definition 3.3 MA-110 - the image of a function
> If $\phi:A\longrightarrow B$ is a function from set $A$ to set $B$, and $C\subseteq A$, then the **image** of $C$ under $\phi$, denoted $\phi(C)$, is defined to be the set $\{ b \in B : \text{there is some }c \in C \text{ with }\phi(c)=b \}$.
