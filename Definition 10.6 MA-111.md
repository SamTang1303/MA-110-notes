> [!definition] Definition 10.6 MA-111 - group actions
> A **group action** of a set $G$ on a set $X$ is a way of assigning a function $\phi_{g}: X \longrightarrow X$ to every group element $g \in G$, such that function composition of the $\phi_{g}$'s is compatible with group multiplication, i.e.,
> $$
> \phi_{e}(x)=x \text{ and } \phi_{gh}(x)=\phi_{g}(\phi_{h}(x))
> $$
> for all $g,h \in G$ and all $x \in X$, where $e$ is the identity of $G$.
